    "We get our data from the [publicly available data](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/gcp-public-data-goes-16) NOAA has put on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We'll be specifically using data from March 13th, 2019 (March 14th UTC) over the United States to look at an intense midlatitude cyclone. This case was chosen from a blog post by Scott Lindstrom on the CIMSS Satellite Blog. Scott's blog post can be found [here](http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/goes/blog/archives/32345) which includes much more in-depth analysis.\n",

    "A common operation done with satellite data is to resample the data to a gridded area with uniform pixel sizes. In addition to helping us resolve bands to the same resolution (see above), this also allows us to change the geographic projection of the data or to crop out a specific region of interest to study. SatPy currently provides a \"native\" resampling method for the cases where we don't want to change the projection or coverage, but only unify the resolutions of the currently loaded data. This is fast because we are only replicating or aggregating data points. There is also a \"nearest\" or nearest neighbor resampling method to handle the other cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by using the \"native\" resampler to make all bands match the resolution of the lowest resolution band (2km) to save memory and processing time. This call will automatically detect that \"true_color\" and \"natural_color\" were not created, but can be now. We'll use this Scene later on to make full resolution cloud-optimized geotiffs."
